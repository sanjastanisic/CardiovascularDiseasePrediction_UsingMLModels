\begin{frame}{Introduction}
\protect\hypertarget{introduction}{}

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the most common diseases that cause a
large number of deaths each year. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the
most common type of these diseases worldwide and is the main reason of
heart attacks. Thus early diagnosis of CAD is very essential and is an
important field of medical studies. Many methods are used to diagnose
CAD so far. These methods can help in reducing cost and deaths.

Emerging machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM) technologies are
beginning to transform medicine and healthcare and could also improve
the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases, including CAD.

The dataset under study is the Heart Disease Dataset, available on the
IEEE Data Port Platform {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-ieeedataport}{1}{]}.
This database provides comprehensive and fundamental information on
early detection of CAD disease in order to illuminate the patterns and
processes that are used in ML/DM approaches. Heart Disease Dataset is
curated by combining 5 popular heart disease datasets already available
independently but notcombined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets
are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest
heartdisease dataset available so far for research purposes. The
datasets used for its curation are Cleveland, Hungaria, Switzerland,
Long Beach and Statlog (Heart).

This dataset consists of 1190 instances with 11 features:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  ``age'' - Age of the individual, numeric (expressed in years)
\item
  ``sex'' - Gender of the individual, binary (0 = female, 1= male)
\item
  ``cholesterol'' - Individual's serum cholesterol level, numeric
  (expressed in mg/dl)
\item
  ``chest\_pain\_type'' - Type of chest pain, nominal (0 = typical
  angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic)
\item
  ``resting\_bp\_s'' - Resting blood pressure of the individual, numeric
  (expressed in mm Hg)
\item
  ``fasting\_blood\_sugar'' - If blood sugar of the individual is high
  e.g.~\textgreater{} 120 mg/dl, binary (1 = true; 0 = false)
\item
  ``resting\_ecg'' - Resting electrocardiogram results of the
  individual, nominal (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality
  e.g.~T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of
  \textgreater{} 0.05 mV, 2 = showing probable or definite left
  ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)
\item
  ``max\_heart\_rate'' - Maximum heart rate that is achieved, numeric
\item
  ``exercise\_angina'' - Exercise induced angina, binary (1 = yes, 0 =
  no)
\item
  ``oldpeak'' - oldpeak of the individual, numeric (measures depression)
\item
  ``ST\_slope'' - The slope of the peak within exercise ST segment,
  nominal (1 = upsloping, 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping)
\end{enumerate}

Dataset contains one dependent variable,``target'', which represents
class of the individual, binary (1 = heart disease, 0 = normal).

The goal of this analysis is to predict if the given individual have
heart disease using machine learning tools and evaluate the goodness of
the predictions.

This report is organized in sections, as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Preprocessing}. Here, in order to make the dataset more
  suitable for analysis, the missing values are checked and treated (if
  necessary), dataset features are analyzed and transformed.
\item
  \textbf{Data exploration}. In this section, features from the dataset
  are analyzed, with focus on the existance of the heart disease.
\item
  \textbf{Models}. This section describes the different models used in
  this report to predict the ilness.
\item
  \textbf{Implementation and evaluation}. Implementation of the
  previously selected models, implementation of whole ML/DM workflow and
  evaluation of compared models are described in this section.
\item
  \textbf{Conclusion}. At the end, conclusions are emphases as the final
  section of the report.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Preprocessing}
\protect\hypertarget{preprocessing}{}

Firstly, it should be checked is there missing values in dataset.

\begin{verbatim}
##                 age                 sex         cholesterol             oldpeak 
##                   0                   0                   0                   0

##                   0                   0                   0                   0

\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
##                 age                 sex         cholesterol             oldpeak 
##                   0                   0                   0                   0 
##              target     chest_pain_type fasting_blood_sugar         resting_ecg 
##                   0                   0                   0                   0 
##     exercise_angina            ST_slope        resting_bp_s      max_heart_rate 
##                   0                   0                   0                   0
\end{verbatim}

Obtained result indicate that thete is no misisng values. Therefore,
there is no need to correct existng data.

After that, we should look for invalid values - values that are out of
meanningfull doman.

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "age"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 0
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "sex"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 0
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "resting_bp_s"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 0
\end{verbatim}

It can be concluded that all values for attributes ``age'', ``sex'' and
``resting\_bp\_s'' are within required range, so there in ton need for
improving that data.

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "with cholesterol level 0"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 172
\end{verbatim}

As can be seen, there are 172 individuals in this dataset whose
cholesterol level is set to 0.

First proposition is that level 0 indicate ``normal'' chorestelol level.
In that case, in order to improve value of the feature ``cholesterol'',
correction should be applied. Therefore, healty individuals with
original choresterol level 0, it will be set to value 170, which is
``normal'' value, according to {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-medline}{2}{]}.

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "healthy, with cholesterol level 0"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 20
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "ill, with cholesterol level 0"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 152
\end{verbatim}

However, further data examination shows that among individuals with
colesterol level set to 0, there are much more them with hart disease
(152) than the normal ones (20). Therefore, the first proposition dosn't
hold, so the proposed correction will be missleading.

Therefore, that some other type of correction sholud be applied. Simlpy
removing 172 rows from data set is not good option - on that case,
dataset is shrinked form more than 10\% of its original size.

In this situation, the chosen policy is to calculate Q1 and Q3 fo
cholesterol level in part of population that have inserted cholesterol
level, to set cholesterol level for 152 unhelthy individuals to
uniformely dispersed value closed to Q3, and for 20 healthy individuals
to uniformely dispersed value closed to Q1, where Q1 and Q3 calculation
are based on the subpopulation that have cholesterol level bigger than
0.

Therefore, cholesterol level for 20 healthy individuals will be set to
values around 209, and for 152 unhealthy individuals to values around
276.

\begin{verbatim}
## Empty data.table (0 rows and 12 cols): age,sex,cholesterol,oldpeak,target,chest_pain_type...
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## Empty data.table (0 rows and 12 cols): age,sex,cholesterol,oldpeak,target,chest_pain_type...
\end{verbatim}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data exploration}
\protect\hypertarget{data-exploration}{}

Since the research question is to predict if the individual has CAD, so
variable ``target'' to be the dependent variable in this analysis. That
variable is treated as a discrete attribute and its prediction will be
executed as classification process.

\textbf{1. Distribution of outcome}

In this section, distribution of ``target'' is examinated.

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "target"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## .
##        normal heart disease 
##           561           629
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-9-1.pdf}

Within dataset of 1190 individuals, there are 629 that suffered with
heart attack, and 561 that not suffered.

Corelations about ``target'' and other dataset features will be further
examinate in subsequent sections.

\textbf{2. Corelation}

Corelation among variables in dataset is calculated and displayed on the
following diagram.

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-10-1.pdf}

In this diagram, positive corelation is marked with different shades of
blue, while negative correlation is marked with different shades of red.
More intesive color indicate that correlation is higher.

\textbf{3. Feature ``age''}

From diagram that display corelation among all columns can be seen that
``age'' is not directly highly correlated with ``target'', but is is
significantly corelated with ``max heart rate'', which is further highly
correlated with ``target'', so feature ``age'' can not be excluded from
further analysis.

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "age"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##   28.00   47.00   54.00   53.72   60.00   77.00
\end{verbatim}

Obtained data and digrams indicate that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Minimum age is 28 and Maximum age is 77. Average age of population is
  53.72.
\item
  Maximum number of population lying between age group 54 and 60 years.
\end{itemize}

Subsequently, visualization of the ``age'' distribution will give more
insights.

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-12-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-12-2.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-12-3.pdf}

The following diagrams visualize connection between ``age'' and
``target'' in the data set under consideration.

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-13-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-13-2.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-13-3.pdf}

In those diagrams, red surface indicate people with hearth disesases
(``target'' is 1), while green surface indicate people that have no
herath disease (``target'' is 0).

The diagrams indicate that there is a connection between ``age'' and
``taget'' and nature of that connection is subject of further analysis.

\textbf{4. Feature ``sex''}

Concerning "sex attribute, several analysis are done.

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "sex"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## .
##   male female 
##    281    909
\end{verbatim}

Out of 1190 bservations, 281 of them are male and 909 are female.

From the diagram that displays all column corelations, it is clear that
that there is significant corellation between ``sex'' and ``target''.

After that, ``sex'' distribution and joint ``sex'', ``age'' distribution
are considered.

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-15-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-15-2.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-15-3.pdf}
Insights:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  From the barplot, it is clearly Visible that proportion of male is
  more as compared to female.
\item
  It this dataset, it seems that ``sex'' and ``age'' are not corelated.
\end{itemize}

After that, influense that ``sex'' have to ``target'' is visualized on
the following diagrams:

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-16-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-16-2.pdf}

From joint target, sex distribution diagrams, it can be seen that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Diagrams with joint distribution of ``sex'' and target further confirm
  the finding that there is correlation between them.
\item
  In case of not suffered with heart attack, female is very less (211
  vs.~80) while more male has suffered heart attack (350 vs.~559).
\item
  Now when we look at the population suffered with attack it can be
  seeing clearly that more male suffered with heart attack (558 vs 70).
\end{itemize}

Therefore, attribute ``sex'' should not be neglected in further
analysis.

\textbf{5. Feature ``cholesterol''}

In this subsection, influence of cholestrol level to final outcome is
studied. Cholesterol level is already corrected in preprocessing phase.

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "cholesterol"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
##    85.0   209.0   240.0   245.9   276.0   603.0     172
\end{verbatim}

It can be seen that minimum cholestrol among patients is 85, maxmum is
603 and average cholestrol is 245.9.

Cholesterol distribution, as well as corelation between ``cholesterol''
and feature ``sex'' are examined and visualized.

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-18-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-18-2.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-18-3.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-18-4.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-18-5.pdf}

It can be concluded that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Cholesterol data distribution have peak located near to 280 unit and
  that peak is enlarged within preprocessing step, when invalid data are
  improvied.
\item
  In boxplot for descriptive cholesterol analysis seperately for male
  and female is also clear that male has lower colestrol than female.
\item
  We can clearly see in two last diagrams that maximum population have
  cholestrol between 200 and 250 unit.
\end{itemize}

At the end, let us examine joint distributions of ``cholesterol'' and
``target''.

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-19-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-19-2.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-19-3.pdf}

It can be seen that there are ore healthy persons with lower level of
holesterol, than the ill ones. This confirms existence some kind of
correlation between ``cholesterol'' and ``target'',

As a final conslusion, ``cholesterol'' should be considered in further
analysis.

\emph{6. Feature ``chest\_pain\_type''}

In this section, influence of ``chest\_pain\_type'' on ``target'' is
stydied.

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "chest_pain_type"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## .
##   typical angina  atypical angina non-anginal pain     asymptomatic 
##               66              216              283              625
\end{verbatim}

There is 4 category of chest pain (``typical angina'', ``atypical
angina'', ``non-anginal pain'' and ``asymptomatic'') with frequencies
66, 216, 283 and 625 respectively.

After that, distribution of ``chest\_pain\_type'', and its relations to
features ``age'', ``sex'' and ``cholesterol'' are visualized.

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-21-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-21-2.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-21-3.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-21-4.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-21-5.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-21-6.pdf}
Insights:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  From the first barplot ``Chest pain type distribution'' it is clear
  that most people having type of asymptomatic chest pain, followed by
  non anginal chest pain.
\item
  People with age among 50 and 65 more often feel asymptomatic chest
  pain.
\item
  Within male subpopulation, asymptomatic chest pain ocures twor times
  more often than non anginal chest pain.
\item
  Within female subpopulation, occurences of asymptomatic chest pain,
  non-anginal chest pain and atypical angina are close.
\end{itemize}

At the end of this discussion, corelation betwwen ``chest\_pain\_type''
and ``target'' is visualized:

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-22-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-22-2.pdf}
Last two diagrams indicate that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  People with asymtpomatic chest pain are more likely to get heart
  attack.
\item
  For other types of chest pain, prognossis is better.
\end{itemize}

\emph{7. Feature ``resting\_bp\_s''}

Now,blood pressure analysis while resting is done.

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "resting_bp_s"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##    80.0   120.0   130.0   132.3   140.0   200.0
\end{verbatim}

Insights: - Minimum RBP(rest blood pressure) is 80 and Maximum is 200. -
Average RBP is 132.2

We can see diagrams for descriptive analysis of ``resting\_bp\_s'' and
diagrams that visuelize its correlation to features ``sex'' and
``chest\_pain\_type''.

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-24-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-24-2.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-24-3.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-24-4.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-24-5.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-24-6.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-24-7.pdf}

From previous diagrams, definitive conclusions about features can not be
drawn.

Let us analize correspondance between ``resting\_bp\_s'' and ``target''.

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-25-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-25-2.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-25-3.pdf}

Insights:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  There is low positive correlation between ``resting\_bp\_s'' and
  ``target'', so with increasing ``resting\_bp\_s'' chance of getting
  heart attack will increase.
\item
  This can clearly see in histograms - maximum number of population have
  rest blood pressure between 120 and 140.
\item
  Also can be seen that probability of heart attack is decreasing after
  rest blood pressure goes over 135.
\end{itemize}

\emph{8 Feature ``fasting\_blood\_sugar''}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "fasting_blood_sugar"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## .
## false  true 
##   935   254
\end{verbatim}

This is a categorical Variable in which 0 means level is less than 120
unit and 1 means it is greater than 120 unit. It is clearly visible that
maximum (85\% of the population) Peoples have ``fasting\_blood\_sugar''
less than 120.

Concerning corelations with other features, situaction is as follows:

From previous diagrams, no additional info about feature corelations
with ``fasting\_blood\_sugar'' can not be established.

The following diagrams display corelation between
``fasting\_blood\_sugar'' and ``target''.

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-28-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-28-2.pdf}

Diagrams indicate that higher fasting blood sugar increase probability
of heart attack.

\emph{9. Feature ``resting\_ecg''}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "resting_ecg"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## .
##                       normal having ST-T wave abnormality 
##                          683                          181 
##             showing probable 
##                          325
\end{verbatim}

Thas feature describes ECG result while individual is resting. There are
3 categories (``normal'', ``having ST-T wave abnormality'', ``showing
probable''). Category ``having ST-T wave abnormality'' of ECG is rare.

We will check correlation between this feature and other previously
mentioned features. The following diagrams helsp is visualizing this:

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-30-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-30-2.pdf}

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-30-5.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-30-6.pdf}
Diagrams indicate that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Younger people more often have normal resting ECG.
\item
  People with normal chorestelol more often jave normal resting ECG.
\item
  People with blood preasure that is not high more often have normal
  resting ECG.
\item
  Men, proportionaly, more often have normal resting ECG that it is case
  with women.
\end{itemize}

Concerning corelation between ``resting\_ecg'' and ``target'', situation
is as follows:

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-31-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-31-2.pdf}

Diagrams indicate that people with ST-T wave abnormality will have
higher chances to get heart hiseasses than people from other types of
resing ECG.

\emph{10. Feature ``max\_heart\_rate''}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "max_heart_rate"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##    60.0   121.0   140.0   139.7   160.0   202.0
\end{verbatim}

That feature describes maximum heart rate. This is continous data with
minimum heart rate achieved 66 and maximum 202.

Let us visualize corelation between ``max\_heart\_rate'' and other
features:

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-33-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-33-2.pdf}

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-33-6.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-33-7.pdf}
It can be concluded that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Density have two peaks, one around 120 and the other around 150.
\item
  In boxplot we can see that male more often achieve higher maximum
  heart rate achieved than female. Therefore, maximim heart rate is
  depending on age.
\item
  It can be seen that atypical angina and non-anginal pain occure more
  often when individual have higher resting blood preasure.
\end{itemize}

At the end, let us visualze links between ``max\_heart\_rate'' and
``target''.

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-34-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-34-2.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-34-3.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-34-4.pdf}

We can see that there are many people with heart problem that have not
so high maximum heart rate..

\emph{11. Feature ``exercise\_angina''}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "exercise_angina"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## .
##  no yes 
## 728 461
\end{verbatim}

Angine is a type of chest pain caused by induced flow of blood to heart.
Feature ``exercise\_angina'' represents info if chosen individual
excercises angina, or not. This variable is categorical.

The following diagrams visualize distribution of ``exercise\_angina'',
and correlation between this feature and other previously mentioned
features:

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-36-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-36-2.pdf}

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-36-5.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-36-6.pdf}

We can clearly see that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Older people tent to exercise angina more often.
\item
  People with lower cholesterol level tend to exercise angina more
  rarely.
\item
  People with normal resting blod preasure tend to exercise angina more
  rarely.
\item
  Proportionaly, women exercise angina more often.
\end{itemize}

Following diagrams display corelation between ``exercise\_angina'' and
``target'':

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-37-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-37-2.pdf}

From previous diagrams, it is clear that with increase in
``exercise\_angina'', chance of heart attack is increasing.

\emph{12. Feature ``oldpeak''}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "oldpeak"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
## -2.6000  0.0000  0.6000  0.9223  1.6000  6.2000
\end{verbatim}

Feature ``oldpeak'' represents ST depression induced by exercise
relative to rest.

Insights:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  This variable is numeric with minimum being -2.60 and maximum 6.20
\item
  We can see thar maximum population is lying between 0 - 1.6.
\item
  Data is right skewed, not normally distributed.
\end{itemize}

Diagrams that visuelize distribution of ``oldpeak'' and its correlation
to other features are, as follows:

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-39-1.pdf}

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-39-6.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-39-7.pdf}

In those diagrams, we can see that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  There are are some outliers, is represented by circle above boxplot.
\item
  Also, feature ``oldpeak'' is generally bigger within male as compared
  to female.
\end{itemize}

Here is visualization of relationsheep between ``oldpeak'' and
``target''.

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-40-3.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-40-4.pdf}

In previous smooth curves between ``oldpeak'' and ``target'' we can see
that there is a trend between them.

\emph{13. Feature ``ST\_slope''}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "ST_slope"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## .
##   upsloping        flat downsloping 
##         527         581          81
\end{verbatim}

That feature indicate if slope of peak. This is category variable with 3
categories: upsloping, flat and downsloping.

Following diagrams display ``ST\_slope'' distribution, and connection
between this feature and all other features:

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-42-1.pdf}

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-42-5.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-42-6.pdf}

Insights:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Within population upsloping ST slope and flat ST slope are nearly same
  and in maximum number.
\item
  People with age between 55 and 65 years have more flat and more
  downsloping ST slopes in comparison to other.
\item
  Small part od male population have downsloping ST slope.
\end{itemize}

At the end of this section, visualization of relationsheep between
``ST\_slope'' and ``target'' is made:

\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-43-1.pdf}
\includegraphics{Sanja_Stanisic_CAD_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-43-2.pdf}

Let us denote that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  People with oldpeak category flat is more likely to get heart attack.
\item
  People with category upsloping is less likely to get heart attack.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Models}
\protect\hypertarget{models}{}

Different Machine Learning models were chosen for predicting the
``target'' variable. Here is the list of models that are used in this
report:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  k Nearest Neihbours (\textbf{k-nn}), described in
  {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-murphy}{3}, pp. 16--18{]}. An object is
  classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being
  assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is
  a positive integer, typically small). I
\item
  Naive Bayes (\textbf{nb}), explained in
  {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-murphy}{3}, pp. 82--95{]}. It is simple
  ``probabilistic classifier'' based on applying Bayes' theorem, with
  strong (e.g.~naïve) assumptions of independence between the features.
  In other words, naive Bayes classifier assume that the value of a
  particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature,
  given the class variable.
\item
  SVM with Linear Kernel (\textbf{svm-l}), described in
  {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-murphy}{3}, pp. 482--486{]}. Training
  algorithm of SVM builds a model that assigns new examples to one
  category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear
  classifier.
\item
  SVM with Radial Kernel (\textbf{svm-r}), also described in
  {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-murphy}{3}, pp. 498--505{]}. It is using the
  kernel trick, which implicitly maps kernel inputs into
  high-dimensional feature spaces where features are linearly separable.
  In this case kernel is defined with Gaussian radial basis function,
  given by formula:
\end{itemize}

\[k(x_{i}, x_{j}) = e ^ {- \sigma {|x_{i} - x_{j}|}^2 }\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Random Forest (\textbf{rf}), also described in
  {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-murphy}{3}, pp. 550--553{]}. Random forest
  operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time
  and outputting the value that is mean/average prediction of the
  individual trees.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Implementation and evaluation}
\protect\hypertarget{implementation-and-evaluation}{}

It is clear that various different alternatives and experiments should
be created during ML process implementation.

Because of its popularity, efficiency, simplicity and flexibility and
because of author's previous experience, R language and environment for
statistical computing and graphics
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-rfoundations}{4}{]} is used to implement the
ML process. A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each
internal node represents a ``test'' on an attribute, each branch
represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a
class label (decision taken after computing all attributes). It is clear
that paths from root to leaf represent classification rules.

The following ML predictor models are developed with R functions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Function `knn' {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-rfunknn}{5}{]} in library
  `class' {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-rbibclass}{6}{]} is used for k-nn
  model realization.
\item
  Function `NaiveBayes' {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-rfunnaivebayes}{7}{]}
  in library `klaR' {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-rbibklar}{8}{]} is used
  for nb model realization.
\item
  Function `ksvm' {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-rfunkvsm}{9}{]} in library
  `kernlab' {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-rbibkernlab}{10}{]} with parameter
  kernel = vanilladot() that represents linear kernel, is used for svm-l
  model realization.
\item
  Function `ksvm' in library `kernlab' with parameter kernel =
  ``rbfdot'' - which represents radial kernel, is used for svm-r model
  realization.
\item
  Function `randomForest'
  {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-rfunrandomforest}{11}{]} in library
  `randomForest'{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-rbibrandomforest}{12}{]} is
  used for rf model realization.
\end{itemize}

Last, but not the least, R function `train'
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-rfuntrain}{13}{]} in library `caret'
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-rbibcaret}{14}{]} is used as umbrella that
covers all the previously mentioned R functions and libraries for ML.
They enables handling of a various learning models and functions in a
uniform manner. In this moment, more than 230 classification and
regression models are ``out-of-a-box'' available for use with `caret'
and all of them are enlisted in
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kuhnam}{15}{]}.

Developed models are compared using k-fold validation
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-murphy}{3}, pp. 201--210{]}, with value of
parameter k is set to 10. Selected 10-fold validation is realized with
caret R functions. In order to achieve exactly the same conditions for
comparison among developed ML methods, in all 10-fold validation
scenarios, random generator is set on predefined value 155294099.

In order to evaluate quality of the selected ML regression methods,
various measures {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-murphy}{3}, pp. 176--194{]}
are used.

The following overall measures are calculated for ML models:

For measuring the performance of algorithms, sensitivity (or recall),
specificity and accuracy were used because these three criteria are used
more in the medical field.

For calculation of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy confusion
matrix is required. In the following table, a confusion matrix is shown:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lcr@{}}
\toprule
& Actual class is C1 & Actual class is C2\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
Predicted class is \emph{C1} & True positive (\(TP\)) & False positive
(\(FP\))\tabularnewline
Predicted class is \emph{C2} & False negative (\(TN\)) & True negative
(\(TN\))\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Cells in confusion matrix have the following meaning
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-alizedah2019}{16}{]}: - Actual class is the
class which determined by angiography and it is existed in dataset. -
Predicted class is the one which is predicted by algorithms. - \(TP\) is
number of samples of class C1 which has been correctly classified. -
\(TN\) is number of samples of class C2 which has been correctly
classified. - \(FN\) is number of samples of class C1 which has been
falsely classified as C2. - \(FP\) is number of samples of class C2
which has been falsely classified as C1.

According to confusion matrix, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are
calculated as follows:

\[ Specificity = \frac{TN}{TN+FP} \]

\[ Sensitivity = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}  \]
\[ Accuracy = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}  \]

Quality of the classification algorithm is often displayed by ROC
(receiver operating characteristic) curve. It is a diagram showing the
performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds.
This curve plots two parameters true positive rate (\(TPR\)) and false
positive rate (\(FPR\)).

True Positive Rate (\(TPR\)) is a synonym for recall and is defined as
follows:

\[ TPR = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}  \]

False Positive Rate (\(FPR\)) is defined as follows:

\[ FPR = \frac{FP}{TN+FP}  \]

An ROC curve plots \(TPR\) vs.~\(FPR\) at different classification
thresholds. Lowering the classification threshold classifies more items
as positive, thus increasing both false positives and true positives.

Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) measures the entire two-dimensional area
underneath the entire ROC curve (think integral calculus) from (0,0) to
(1,1).

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
\protect\hypertarget{conclusion}{}

The goal of this report is predicting the if individual experience heart
disease, starting from his measurable features.

In order to do so, five ML regression models are proposed and its
implementations are compared, under the same conditions. Models that are
implemented based on k-Nearest Neghbours, on Naive Bayes, on Support
Vector Machine (with Linear and Radial Kernel) and on Random Forest. In
this situation, Random Frest based method was significantly better than
its counterparts.

At the end, reader should take care not to jump too early to general
conclusions. In other words, as stated in
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-murphy}{3}, pp. 24--25{]}, if obtained results
indicate quality of proposed ML model for this specific prediction
problem, the same ML model will very likely be inadequate for the other
problem. Formal mathematical proof of this statement, widely known as No
free lunch theorem for supervised learning, introduced in paper
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-walpert1996}{17}{]}.
